"""
Write a function to check whether a given string is "smashable", 
meaning that it’s a word in a predefined dictionary and can be reduced 
to a single character, one character at a time, and every intermediate 
word during the reduction is also in the dictionary of words. (Assume you 
have a file or list of valid dictionary words, like /usr/share/dict/words)
Example: Given the word SPRINT as input, it should return the following:
SPRINT → PRINT → PINT → PIT → IT → I
