Linked List Problems:
* Given a singly-linked list, find the middle item in the list.
* Given a singly-linked list, reverse the order of the list by modifying the nodes’ links.
* Given a linked list, rearrange the elements by interleaving the first half of the linked list with the second half.
Example: If the given linked list is A → B → C → D → E → F → G → H, nodes should be rearranged so the list becomes A → C → E → G → B → D → F → H.
* Rotate a given linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes, where k is a given integer.
Example: If the given linked list is A → B → C → D → E → F and k is 4, nodes should be modified so the list becomes E → F → A → B → C → D.
Assumptions: k is positive and smaller than n, the length of the linked list.
* Given an array of k linked lists, each of whose items are in sorted order, 
combine all nodes (do not create new nodes) into a single linked list with all items in order.
